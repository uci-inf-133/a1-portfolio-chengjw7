    <p>
      I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of California, Irvine, with a minor in Statistics and a strong interest in systems, data analysis, and intelligent applications. Through both coursework and hands-on projects, I have developed experience across a wide range of areas, including compiler construction, operating systems, web development, and IoT system design. During my internship at BrainCo in Shanghai, I worked on large-scale cognitive training data analysis for elderly care programs, building Python and R pipelines to process behavioral and physiological metrics and helping design machine learning models to evaluate cognitive improvement. I enjoy working at the intersection of theory and practice, turning complex technical problems into reliable, real-world systems, and I am especially motivated by projects that combine software engineering with meaningful social impact. I also like playing video games!

          relevance-based result ordering. The system handles large-scale document
          processing, duplicate detection, and query optimization.
